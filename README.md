👋🏼 About Me

Hi, I'am Wiame Elalami (#WhyLylasCode), I have been interested in computer science since I was young, I have always loved rummaging my PC. I have been in higher education in ecomics and law for two years, but that does not interest me. I decided to drop everything to follow what I really love : web develepment. So here I am ! ✨

👩🏻‍💻 My skills

I completeely manage HTML and CSS, I acquired several notions of JavaScript on the Front-End side, so I continue to learn about the dynamic side of a page web / application for several weeks now. I am thus at the point for the management of the different versions of a project and the sharing with other developers of the same project thanks to Git and GitHub. I am constantly learning to improve myself day by day.
